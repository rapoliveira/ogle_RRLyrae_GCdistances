## To-Do-List :: RR Lyrae analysis in GCs 

<!-- This script multiplies...

The main script is [fit_1L2S_3steps.py](https://github.com/rapoliveira/MulensModel/blob/master/exploring_MulensModel/fit_1L2S_3steps.py), which does... -->

### Old list: 2021-2022
- [X] 1) Finish membership() function
- [X] Compute \<V>/\<I> weighted by the memb.
- [X] Improve Fig. RA-DEC (circle & Gaia)
- [X] Improve PMs figure (2D-Gaussian)
- [X] Choose a new cluster from Harris
- [X] Reload fits catalogues from Python
- [X] Astropy.Table() to save/read cats
- [X] NGC6266: problem with RA/DEC clem
- [X] Apply the Gaia quality-flags!!!
- [X] Problem with prev-results (Vmag)
- [X] Insert Tables in each function called from main()... --> remove
- [ ] Memb. probability from 2D-Gaussians
- [ ] err_field is missing in GMM-2D
- [ ] Write the 5+ get functions in external!!
- [ ] Missing: Gaia catalogue of RRLs*
- [ ] Work in the case of 0 stars in OGLE*
- [ ] Test Astropy's sigma_clip
- [ ] Cross-match with best photometry
- [ ] [...]    [...]    [...]    [...]
- [ ] Save the PM-cleaned Gaia photometry
- [ ] RDP with Gaia: AngSep and King profile
- [ ] Put the alpha in prev file (review)
- [ ] Recheck HP1 and other with few stars (L: field has too big weight)
- [ ] Fix the membership scale in the VPD
- [ ] DECIDE ABOUT RUWE AND NO_EXCESS FLAGS :: RUWE < 2.0 is good for now!

### New list: 2024
- [ ] Adapting for Leandro...
