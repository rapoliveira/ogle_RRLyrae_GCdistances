# Analysis of RR Lyrae data in GCs from Clement, OGLE and Gaia

This code is based on [...] Oliveira+2022

### Pre-requisites
Requires Python 3.7+ and the libraries listed in requirements.txt, which can be installed with ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` or manually with pip/conda. A user and login must already be registered at [Gaia-ESA CAS](https://cas.cosmos.esa.int/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Ftools.cosmos.esa.int%2Fprivacy%2Findex.php), and must be inserted in the file GaiaEDR3/my_credentials.txt.

### Inputs (TBD)
- Inquirer inputs... NGC6266 is an example!

### Description of the outputs
- Catalogues from Clement, OGLE, Gaia EDR3 and cross-match
- Auxiliary cats with memberships and mean magnitudes for all RR Lyrae
- Figures to be saved...
