(1998a) does not            C0325p794 indicate any obvious HB stars. Based on this and on the metal                C0325p794 abundance they derived, [Fe/H]=-0.6, (1998, AJ 115, 658), Rosenberg          C0325p794 et al. (1998b) concluded that Palomar 1 is a very young globular cluster.    C0325p794 The young age (as much as 8 Gyr younger than 47 Tuc) was confirmed by        C0325p794 Sarajedini et al. (2007) who also said they could not rule out the           C0325p794 possibility that Palomar 1 has been misclassified as a globular cluster.     C0325p794 An analysis by Monaco et al. (2011)  indicated that the chemical             C0325p794 abundance is similar to that of Galactic open clusters. They proposed        C0325p794 that Pal 1 might be a globular cluster that experienced a peculiar           C0325p794 chemical evolution or an open cluster ejected from the Galactic disk.        C0325p794 From a study of tidal tails, Niederste-Ostholt et al. (2010) suggested       C0325p794 that Pal 1 may have been accreted from a now disrupted dwarf galaxy          C0325p794 about 500 Myr ago.                                                           C0354m498 Aaronson et al. (1984) published a BV color-magnitude diagram that           C0354m498 indicates this object is a globular cluster with a prominent red             C0354m498 horizontal branch.  A VI color-magnitude diagram by Dotter et al.            C0354m498 (2008) confirms this. Thus it is a "second parameter" cluster" in the        C0354m498 sense that it has a red HB compared with inner halo clusters with the        C0354m498 same metallicity, [Fe/H] = -1.70.  The metallicity was derived by            C0354m498 Suntzeff et al. (1985) based on the calcium H and K line strengths of two    C0354m498 giants.                                                                      C0422m213 Ortolani & Gratton (1986) published a BV color-magnitude diagram             C0422m213 that showed an extremely red HB.  A  VI color-magnitude diagram by           C0422m213 Stetson et al.

(1997).  They found a            C0443p313 well populated red horizontal branch with a sparser extension to the         C0443p313 blue. Based on this, they concluded that it is likely that Pal 2             C0443p313 contains RR Lyrae variables, but their observational data were not           C0443p313 suitable for performing a search.                                            C0443p313 A VI color-magnitude diagram published by Sarajedini et al. (2007)           C0443p313 confirms that the HB is bimodal in color and that the cluster is             C0443p313 located in a direction of high foreground absorption and differential        C0443p313 reddening.                                                                   C0512m400 The periods, magnitudes, amplitudes and variability types                    C0512m400 for the RR Lyrae variables numbered up to V33 are from                       C0512m400 Walker (1998). All of them are considered to be cluster members.             C0512m400 The RA and dec for V1-33 are from Samus et al. (2009).                       C0512m400 For variables V34-52, the data are from Sumerel+ (2004IBVS.5533....1S)       C0512m400 unless indicated otherwise in the notes on individual stars.                 C0512m400 The data for V53-55 and PSR are from the discovery papers.                   C0522m245 A major paper on the variables in NGC 1904 (M79) is by Kains et al.          C0522m245 (2012).  They carried out a thorough analysis of the RR Lyrae variables.     C0522m245 In the above table, all the data for V3-7 and V9-14 are from the study       C0522m245 by Kains et al.                                                              C0522m245 V2 and V8 were saturated in their reference images, so the RA and dec        C0522m245 for these two stars are from Samus et al. (2009) and  the magnitude,         C0522m245 amplitude and classification for V2 are from Rosino (1952). It seems         C0522m245 probable that V8 might also be a semi-regular, like V2.                      C0647m359 The RA and dec for V1-4 are from Samus et al. (2009) and their period,       C0647m359 magnitudes, amplidues and classification are from Clement et al.             C0647m359 (1995).                                                                      C0647m359 This cluster is currently undergoing disruption. De Marchi & Pulone          C0647m359 (2007) found a deficiency of low-mass stars and estimated that the           C0647m359 cluster has lost 85% of its original mass.  Balbinot et al. (2011)           C0647m359 have detected several extra-tidal features, including a leading and          C0647m359 trailing tail around NGC 2298.                                               C0734p390 All of the data listed in the above table are from the V photometry          C0734p390 reported by Di Criscienzo et al. (2011a). Their study also included          C0734p390 BI data.                                                                     C0734p390 NGC 2419 is one of the brightest GCs in the Milky Way. Recent studies        C0734p390 by Bruns & Kroupa (2011), Cohen et al. (2010) and Di Criscienzio et          C0734p390 al. (2011b) all support the hypothesis that this cluster is the remnant      C0734p390 of a much more massive system.  The cluster also has a large population      C0734p390 of blue straggler stars.  Dalessandro et al. (2008) published RA, Dec,       C0734p390 and BVI photometry for 232 BSS candidates and noted that their radial        C0734p390 distribution was essentially the same as that of the other stars in the      C0734p390 cluster.                                                                     C0906m370 Pyxis is a distant globular cluster, located approximately 40 kpc from       C0906m370 the Galactic centre.  A CM diagram published by Dotter et al. (2011),        C0906m370 based on HST photometry, shows a prominent red HB.  Harris (1996)            C0906m370 lists [Fe/H] = -1.20 in the 2010 update to his catalogue.                    C0911m646 V1-12: The RA and Dec are from Samus et al. (2009) and are updated           C0911m646 from an earlier paper by Evstigneeva et al. (1997).                          C0911m646 Most of the remaining information for these stars (except V1, V6 and         C0911m646 V11) is from Clement & Hazen (1989).  Lebzelter & Wood (2011) derived        C0911m646 periods and magnitudes for V1 and V11 as part of their study of long         C0911m646 period variables and Kunder et al. (2011) derived a period, magnitude        C0911m646 and amplitude for V6 in their investigation of RR Lyrae variables.           C0911m646 V13-30: The periods and classifications for most of these variables          C0911m646 are from a paper by Corwin et al. (2004).  [For the stars indicated by K11   C0911m646 in the comments column, the data were derived by Kunder et al. (2011).]      C0911m646 Corwin et al. (2004) did not derive magnitudes or amplitudes because they    C0911m646 used the image subtraction method.                                           C0911m646 The RA and dec listed for V13-V30 in the above table were provided           C0911m646 independently by Corwin (2010, private communication) because there          C0911m646 were errors in the coordinates they published in Table 1 on page             C0911m646 669 of their 2004 paper.                                                     C0911m646 V31-50: The RA, dec, periods and mean magnitudes are from Lebzelter &        C0911m646 Wood (2011) who designated them as LW1-20.  The amplitudes listed for        C0911m646 these stars have been estimated to the nearest 0.1 mag from their            C0911m646 published light curves.                                                      C0921m770 The data for V1-2 are from the discovery paper by Mochejska et al.           C0921m770 (2000)                                                                       C0921m770 Sarajedini et al. (2007) published a CM diagram which showed no              C0921m770 HB population. They concluded that this indicates there has been             C0921m770 significant mass segregation and/or mass loss.                               C1003p003 The RA and dec for V1-12 are from Samus et al. (2009).                       C1003p003 The remaining data for V1-3 are from Gratton & Ortolani (1984). The          C1003p003 data for V5-12 are from Borissova et al. (1998) where the adopted mean V     C1003p003 magnitudes are the means of the magnitudes that they listed for each         C1003p003 star.  In their paper, V5-12 were listed as BS58, V1-5 and V9-10             C1003p003 respectively.                                                                C1003p003 All of the data for V13-14 are from Stetson et al.

(1999).                      C1015m461 They published ID charts in an earlier paper (Samus et al. 1996).            C1015m461 Fourcade et al. (1966) also published charts, but Samus et al. (1996)        C1015m461 pointed out that some of Fourcade's identifications were erroneous.          C1015m461 Most of the elements for variables V1-100 are taken from Layden &            C1015m461 Sarajedini (2003) because their study was the most comprehensive.            C1015m461 (They also confirmed the "CST" classification that was previously            C1015m461 reported by Wright (1941) and Kukarkin (1971) for V33, V70, V74,             C1015m461 V75 and V82.)                                                                C1015m461 However, some variables were outside the Layden & Sarajedini field           C1015m461 which was approximately 9.5 by 10 arcmin.  In these cases, data from         C1015m461 other sources are listed and this is indicated in the remarks column:        C1015m461   P02 refers to a CCD investigation by Piersimoni et al. (2003).             C1015m461   C84 refers to the photographic investigation by Cacciari (1984)            C1015m461   W41 refers to stars for which Wright (1941) listed the only available      C1015m461       data.  These stars were all outside the field of the other             C1015m461       studies.  Based on their mean magnitudes and the fact that they        C1015m461       all lie within the 25.3 arcmin tidal radius derived from the           C1015m461       2010 update to the Harris catalogue, they appear to be cluster         C1015m461       members.                                                               C1015m461   K71 refers to Kukarkin (1967,1971a,b).  In 1967 and 1971a, he listed       C1015m461       periods and in 1971b, he published the individual magnitudes.          C1015m461   If no data were available from P02, the C84 data are listed and if C84     C1015m461   did not study the star, the W41 data are listed and failing that, K71.     C1015m461   Kukarkin derived periods for variables announced by Wilkens (1965) that    C1015m461   were outside the field of view in the other studies.  He also              C1015m461   investigated a few of the "outer" variables for which Wright (1941)        C1015m461   was unable to derive periods.                                              C1015m461                                                                              C1015m461   "A" in the remarks column indicates that the period is from the study      C1015m461   by Arellano Ferro et al. (2014). They derived their periods by             C1015m461   combining their observations (made on 4 consecutive nights in March        C1015m461   2013) with those of Layden & Sarajedini (LS).  Arellano Ferro's field      C1015m461   of view was 5.1 by 5.1 arcminutes and included 34 of the 58 RRL stars      C1015m461   observed by LS.                                                            C1015m461   Their paper also includes an excellent finding chart that labels all       C1015m461   of the variable stars in their field of view.                              C1015m461 The data for V101 (=V6 of von Braun & Mateo 2002), V102-112 (V1-11 of        C1015m461 Mazur et al. 2003), V113-121 (Layden & Sarajedini 2003), V122-124            C1015m461 (Arellano Ferro et al. 2014) and V125-160 (Kaluzny et al 2016)  are          C1015m461 from the discovery papers unless indicated otherwise in the notes on         C1015m461 individual stars.                                                            C1015m461 The effects of differential reddening across the face of NGC 3201 are        C1015m461 substantial. This is illustrated in an extinction map published by           C1015m461 von Braun & Mateo (2001) and was taken into account by Arellano Ferro et     C1015m461 al.

Muller (1933, Berlin            C1339p286         Babelsberg Veroff 11, 1) subsequently showed that the northern       C1339p286         component, which he designated as V146, was the variable.            C1339p286         Sawyer Hogg (1939) therefore classified V127 as non-variable         C1339p286         in her first and subsequent catalogs.                                C1339p286         Later, Kholopov (1963) found that the southwest component (his       C1339p286         X34 = vZ 1198) was also variable.                                    C1339p286         Sawyer Hogg (1973) designated X34 as V222 in her 3rd catalog.        C1339p286 V138:   Period, magnitude and amplitude  from Olah and Russev (1979).

(2006), V146 and V222 were                 C1339p286         interchanged by Corwin & Carney (2001) and by Clementini et al.      C1339p286         (2004).  The magnitude and amplitude that we list for V146 in the    C1339p286         above table are the values listed by Corwin & Carney for V222.       C1339p286         Kholopov (1977) pointed out that the observations that Greenstein    C1339p286         (1935) published for V146 are really for  V222.                      C1339p286         See also the comment for V127.                                       C1339p286 V154:   Period, magnitude, amplitude and variability type listed             C1339p286         in the above table are from Kholopov (1972)                          C1339p286 V155:   V29 and V155 were interchanged by Evstigneeva et al.

Amplitude difficult to        C1339p286         estimate because of Blazhko effect.                                  C1339p286 V158:   Greenstein (1935) derived a period of 0.50809 which was listed       C1339p286         by Sawyer Hogg in her catalogs.  However, in her 2nd and 3rd         C1339p286         catalogs, she indicated that the period was uncertain.               C1339p286         Bakos et al. (2000) did not detect any variation.                    C1339p286 V162:   Greenstein (1935) classified this star as non-variable. He noted     C1339p286         that it was part of a triple system.                                 C1339p286         Later Kholopov (1963, Per Zvez 14, 275) found that one of            C1339p286         the other stars in the triplet (vZ 950 = X28) was variable.          C1339p286         Sawyer Hogg (1973) designated vZ 950 as V218 in her 3rd catalog.     C1339p286 V163:   Greenstein (1935) classified this star as non-variable.  Bakos       C1339p286         et al (2000) noted that the x,y position listed in Sawyer Hogg's     C1339p286         catalogs was midway between V180 and a non-variable.  According      C1339p286         to Bakos, Kholopov (1977) labelled the non-variable as V163.         C1339p286         Bakos therefore accepted the non-variable as V163 to avoid           C1339p286         confusion.                                                           C1339p286         See also the comments for V180.                                      C1339p286 V164:   Greenstein (1935) noted that this star was badly blended and         C1339p286         and that, if it was variable, its range was les than 0.35 mag.       C1339p286         Benko et al (2006) classified it as non variable.                    C1339p286         Corwin & Carney derived a period, but according to Clementini        C1339p286         et al. (2004), the star that they studied was V234, not V164.        C1339p286 V165:   Bakos et al. pointed out that there was an error in the sign         C1339p286         of the "y" coordinate listed for this star in Sawyer Hogg's          C1339p286         (1973) 3rd catalog, but it was correct in the 1939 and 1955          C1339p286         editions.  The mean magnitude and amplitude we list for V165         C1339p286         were derived by Benko et al. because Corwin & Carney did not         C1339p286         publish an amplitude or mean magnitude for it.                       C1339p286 V168:   Magnitudes from Benko et al. and amplitude from Corwin & Carney.     C1339p286         See V96.                                                             C1339p286 V179:   Greenstein (1935) commented that the star was difficult to           C1339p286         measure and that if it was variable, it had a small range.           C1339p286         Sawyer (1939) classified it as non-variable in all 3 of her          C1339p286         catalogs. Bakos et al. (2000) were unable to locate the star         C1339p286         unambiguously on POSS images. The RA and dec listed in the           C1339p286         above table were calculated by Samus (2009, private                  C1339p286         communication).  He derived a relation between x,y and RA, dec       C1339p286         based on 39 M3 stars and used it to calculate the RA and dec         C1339p286         for V179 from the published  x,y coordinates.                        C1339p286         There is a 2MASS star in the same location.  The RA and dec          C1339p286         listed in the 2001 on-line update to the catalog were                C1339p286         incorrect.                                                           C1339p286 V180:   V180 = vZ 676: Shapley (1914) stated that vZ676 was composed         C1339p286         of five distinct stars, of which the variable is the brightest       C1339p286         and most centrally located.  Greenstein (1935) could not measure     C1339p286         it because of the crowding. Sawyer (1939) classified it as           C1339p286         non-variable in all three of her catalogs. However, Kholopov         C1339p286         (1977) and Bakos et al. (2000) found that there are two RR Lyrae     C1339p286         variable stars close to (and equidistant from) the position          C1339p286         listed for V180 in Sawyer Hogg's  catalogs.  The eastern component   C1339p286         was chosen by them to be V180 and the western component,             C1339p286         Kholopov's X13 was designated V239 by Bakos et al.                   C1339p286         The period, magnitude, amplitude and classification we list in       C1339p286         the above table are from Bakos et al. (2005). We estimated the       C1339p286         amplitude from their published light curve.                          C1339p286 V182:   Greenstein could not confirm the variability of this star.           C1339p286         Sawyer (1939) classified it as non variable in all three             C1339p286         of her catalogs and Bakos et al. (2000) and Benko et al.             C1339p286         (2006) confirmed its non-varable status.                             C1339p286 V183:   Greenstein commented that V183 was blended with V145.                C1339p286         Sawyer (1939) classified it as non-variable in all three             C1339p286         of her catalogs. Bakos et al. (2000) confirmed its non-variable      C1339p286         status.                                                              C1339p286 V185:   Greenstein commented that this was a bright star with a small        C1339p286         range. Bakos et al. (2000) did not detect any variation. Corwin &    C1339p286         Carney (2001) and Benko et al (2006) did not study it.               C1339p286 V188:   Magnitudes from Benko et al. and amplitude from Corwin & Carney.     C1339p286         See V96.                                                             C1339p286 V192:   Period from Corwin & Carney.

He could          C1339p286         not derive a period because it was a double and difficult            C1339p286         to measure. Bakos et al.  (2000) found that both components          C1339p286         are constant.                                                        C1339p286 V198:   Bakos et al. did not confirm variation in this star based on         C1339p286         one night of observations. However, Corwin & Carney derived          C1339p286         a period from their observations and commented that the star         C1339p286         appears to be slightly above the HB of the CMD.                      C1339p286 V199:   The magnitude and amplitude listed above are from                    C1339p286         Greenstein's (1935) paper. He derived a period of 0.488, but         C1339p286         noted that it was doubtful. Corwin & Carney derived 0.40891,         C1339p286         but indicated that it was uncertain.  They did not publish a         C1339p286         light curve or list a mean magnitude.                                C1339p286 V200:   The period, magnitude and variability type are from Benko et al.     C1339p286         (2006).  The double-mode nature of V200 was first recognized by      C1339p286         Clementini et al. (2004).                                            C1339p286 V204:   This star was incorrectly listed as von Zeipel 390 (instead of       C1339p286         1390) in Sawyer's (1955) 2nd catalog. As a result, its x,y was       C1339p286         incorrect in her 2nd and 3rd catalogs. According to Corwin &         C1339p286         Carney (2001) and Benko et al.  (2006), this star is non-variable.   C1339p286         However, Yao (2007) claims that it is a red HB star with a period    C1339p286         of 0.74785 and V amplitude 0.04.                                     C1339p286                                                                              C1339p286 V205, 206:                                                                   C1339p286         Evstigneeva et al. (1994) pointed out that V205 and 206 are WY       C1339p286         CVn and VZ CVn in the GCVS.                                          C1339p286         The periods and magnitudes we list for these two stars are from      C1339p286         Kukarkin (1960, Ast Tsirk 216, 29).                                  C1339p286 V217:   Guhathakurta et al. (1994) classified this star (Gu9023)             C1339p286         as an RR Lyrae.                                                      C1339p286 V222:   According to Benko et al. (2006), V146 and V222 were                 C1339p286         interchanged by Corwin & Carney (2001) and by Clementini et          C1339p286         al. (2004).  The magnitude and amplitude that we list for V222       C1339p286         in the above table are the values listed by Corwin & Carney for      C1339p286         V146.  See the comment for V146.                                     C1339p286 V224:   Bakos et al. (2000) confirmed that this star was variable, but       C1339p286         also commented that its image merges with that of a nearby star.     C1339p286         It was not investigated further in their subsequent paper (Benko     C1339p286         et al.  2006).                                                       C1339p286 V225:   The period, magnitude and amplitude listed for V95 and               C1339p286         V225 are from Russev (1971). Rosino (1978) classified V95,           C1339p286         V138 and V225 as semi-regular variables.                             C1339p286 V230:   This was Kholopov's (1977) X41. It was not labelled on his ID        C1339p286         chart because it was too far from the cluster centre. It was not     C1339p286         studied by Corwin & Carney (2001) or by Benko et al. (2006).         C1339p286 V234:   According to Corwin & Carney (2001), this star is an RR Lyrae        C1339p286         that might be more distant than the cluster so we have classified    C1339p286         it as a field star. In their investigation, they called the          C1339p286         star V164, but Clementini et al.

However, Contreras et al.

Clusters with Mira variables              C1701m246 generally have red HBs. Also, based on the frequency distribution of         C1701m246 Miras in the surrounding field, it is unlikely that either of the Mira       C1701m246 variables, V10 or V12, are cluster members.                                  C1702m226 The RA and dec in the above table are from Samus et al.

(1982). C1707m265 Clement et al. concluded that the Mira variables were not cluster members    C1707m265 on the basis of the cluster's low metallicity and the frequency distribution C1707m265 of Mira variables in the surrounding field.                                  C1707m265 A BV color-magnitude diagram by Piotto et al. (2002) indicates a             C1707m265 pronounced blue HB.  Clusters with Mira variables generally have red HBs.    C1707m265 Thus it is unlikely that the Mira variables are cluster members.             C1707m265 Discovery of the variable stars in NGC 6293:                                 C1711m294 The cluster NGC 6304 is a metal rich cluster located in a rich field         C1711m294 in the galactic bulge.                                                       C1711m294 The first investigations of variable stars were by Rosino (1962) and         C1711m294 Terzan (1966, 1968), but no periods were derived by either of these          C1711m294 authors.                                                                     C1711m294 A later study of the variables in NGC 6304 and the surrounding               C1711m294 field was by Hartwick et al. (1981).  They derived periods for the 40        C1711m294 RR Lyrae stars in their field and identified a number of other suspected     C1711m294 variables, many of which they classified as long period variables.           C1711m294 It is generally assumed that most of the variables belong to the field       C1711m294 around NGC 6304 and not to the cluster itself.                               C1711m294 De Lee et al. (2006)  carried out a new study of the RR Lyrae variables      C1711m294 to investigate the possibility that some of them might be cluster            C1711m294 members in light of the discovery of long period RR Lyrae variables          C1711m294 in the metal rich clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. They estimated the         C1711m294 membership status based on distance from the cluster, mean                   C1711m294 magnitude and reddening.                                                     C1711m294 The membership status listed for the RR Lyrae variables is based on          C1711m294 their study.                                                                 C1711m294 For RR Lyrae stars with V magnitudes listed in the above table, the          C1711m294 periods, magnitudes and amplitudes are from the OGLE III catalogue           C1711m294 (Sosyzynski et al. 2011).                                                    C1711m294 The periods, classifications and membership status for V5-6, V8-9 and        C1711m294 V11-21 are from Hartwick et al.

The provisional coordinates and the 2MASS coordinates             C1713m280 agreed to within 1 arcsec for all the variables except V11 for which the     C1713m280 difference was 3 arcsec.                                                     C1714m237 This cluster is embedded in a crowded field in the Galactic bulge.           C1714m237 According to the 2010 version of the Harris (1996) catalogue, it is a        C1714m237 core collapsed cluster with [Fe/H] = -1.25.                                  C1714m237 BVI photometry by Ortolani et al.

All of the material in the above table is     C1716m184 from their study unless indicated otherwise in the notes.                    C1716m184 A serious problem in deriving the magnitudes and colours of the stars        C1716m184 in M9 is that the cluster is subject to differential reddening. There is     C1716m184 a heavy obscuring cloud to the southwest of the cluster.  This can be        C1716m184 detected on the photograph published by Clement et al.

(2009).                    C1735m032 There is a systematic offset between the RA values of Samus and Conroy in    C1735m032 the sense that Samus' values are on average 0.2 seconds larger.  Their       C1735m032 dec values agree to within 1 arcsec.                                         C1735m238 NGC 6401 is located in a rich, heavily reddened field in the Galactic bulge. C1735m238 This is illustrated in a VI CM diagram published by Barbuy et al.

The best estimates are based on infrared        C1740m262 spectroscopy of its brightest stars.                                         C1740m262 Stephens & Frogel (2004) derived [Fe/H]=-0.52 +/- 0.11 from medium           C1740m262 resolution K-band spectroscopy of 5 stars.                                   C1740m262 Lee et al.

However,       C1740m262 based on its observed K magnitude and circumstellar extinction, they         C1740m262 concluded that the Mira variable must be a foreground object and not         C1740m262 a cluster member.                                                            C1740m262 Lynch & Ransom (2011) conducted a search for pulsars, but did not find       C1740m262 any in  Palomar 6.                                                           C1742p031 The RA and dec in the above table are from Samus et al.

Thus the red clump is probably        C1744m330 due to field contamination.                                                  C1745m247 The RA and dec for V1 and V2 are from Samus et al.

Because the chemical              C1745m247 abundance patterns are unique, they propose that Terzan 5 is not a           C1745m247 true globular cluster, but a stellar system with a much more complex         C1745m247 history of star formation and chemical enrichment. The nature of the         C1745m247 Terzan 5 stellar system is a subject that continues to be discussed          C1745m247 in the literature.                                                           C1745m247 Terzan 5 has more millisecond pulsars than any other globular cluster.       C1746m203 NGC 6440 is a heavily reddened metal rich cluster near the Galactic          C1746m203 centre.

(2001) based on its 1950 position.                                    C1758m278 This cluster lies in a crowded field near the Galactic centre.               C1758m278 Valenti et al. (2010) published a near IR (K, J-K) CM diagram and            C1758m278 estimated [Fe/H] = -0.65, based on the slope of the RGB.  Harris (1996)      C1758m278 listed V(HB)=17.60 in the 2010 update to his catalogue.

(2014).  These stars are all located within 2               C1758m278 arcminutes of the cluster centre, well within the tidal radius,              C1758m278 10.5 arcminutes, according to the 2010 update to the Harris (1996)           C1758m278 catalogue.  Harris listed half-light radius = 0.83 arcminutes.               C1758m278 These 7 variables have mean <V>= 17.954 according to Soszynski et al.        C1758m278 (2014).  In view of the uncertainties involved in Harris's estimate          C1758m278 of V(HB), it is reasonable to assume that they belong to the cluster.        C1759m089 A VI CM diagram by Kavelaars et al.

According to Lynch et al.

According to Alonso-Garcia          C1800m260 et al.  (2015), they are more accurate than the values Harris listed         C1800m260 in 2010.                                                                     C1800m260 Alonso-Garcia et al. (2015) published a K,J-K CM diagram but found that      C1800m260 it was difficult to disentangle cluster stars from stars in the Galactic     C1800m260 disk and bulge. Contamination by these field stars is significant, even      C1800m260 at distances smaller than the half light radius (1.55 arcminutes).           C1800m260 The data for V1-48 are from the discovery paper by Alonso-Garcia et al.      C1800m260 (2015).  These are the variables that lie within the tidal radius, 5.06      C1800m260 arcminutes, but many of them are probably field stars.                       C1800m260 In fact, Alonso-Garcia et al. concluded that the vast majority of the        C1800m260 unclassified variables are disk field variables, based on their              C1800m260 positions in the CM diagram.                                                 C1800m300 The field around NGC 6522 was observed by Baade (1946, 1951) in his          C1800m300 investigations to characterize the nature of the nucleus of the Milky        C1800m300 Way galaxy and to determine its distance from the Sun.  He used the          C1800m300 Mount Wilson 100-inch telescope to study the field within 16 arcminutes      C1800m300 of the cluster and discovered 285 variable stars.  Their elements were       C1800m300 later published by Gaposchkin (1955).                                        C1800m300 This field is now known as "Baade's window" because it is an area with       C1800m300 relatively low absorption near the Galactic centre and has been the          C1800m300 subject of many studies.                                                     C1800m300 NGC 6522 is a core collapsed cluster with 0.05 arcminute core radius,        C1800m300 1.0 arcminute half-light radius and [Fe/H] = -1.34 according to the          C1800m300 2010 update to the Harris (1996) catalogue.  Soszynski et al. (2011a)        C1800m300 listed a cluster radius of 4.7 arcminutes.                                   C1800m300 Since the cluster is located in a very rich field, only variables that       C1800m300 lie less than 2 arcminutes of the cluster centre have been included          C1800m300 in the above table.  Some of these (e.g. V6) are probably field stars,       C1800m300 while some stars beyond 2 arcminutes might be cluster members.               C1800m300 A proper motion study by Terndrup et al.

However, she also showed      C1804m437 that they all were located within the tidal radius, which at the time,       C1804m437 was considered to be approximately 32 arcminutes, so that firm               C1804m437 conclusions about their membership could not be made.  Now however,          C1804m437 according to the 2010 update of the Harris (1996) catalogue, the             C1804m437 estimated tidal radius of NGC 6541 is approximately 13 arcminutes.           C1804m437 Thus it is probable that most of these variables belong to the               C1804m437 surrounding field.

Their membership status for V1, V3, V5,        C1914p300        V7, V8, V9 and V11 was based on a proper motion study by Rishel       C1914p300        et al.

However, Rosino & Ortolani (1985)         C1916p184 commented that, since they lie in a field rich of Mira variables, it is      C1916p184 possible that they both belong to the field.                                 C1916p184 A VI CM diagram by Kaisler et al.

The cluster is heavily reddened      C1916p184 and also differentially reddened.                                            C1925m304 The periods and variability types in the above table are from Salinas        C1925m304 et al (2005).  No magnitudes or amplitudes were derived because they used    C1925m304 the image subtraction technique for their study. The RA and dec were         C1925m304 provided by Salinas (2013, private communication) and were derived from      C1925m304 the study by Salinas et al. (2012).                                          C1936m310 All the data listed for V1-V15 are from Olech et al. (1999).                 C1936m310 The data for V16-V42 are from the discovery paper by Pych et al. (2001).     C1936m310 They classified V16-V30 as single-mode SXPhe variables and V31-V42 as        C1936m310 double-mode SXPhe variables. For all of the double-mode stars (except        C1936m310 V41), one of the modes is considered to be non-radial in origin. The         C1936m310 periods listed for V31-V42 in the above table are the longer of the          C1936m310 stars' two periods and the amplitudes are the amplitudes associated with     C1936m310 these longer periods (except in the case of V38).                            C1936m310 The data for V43 are from the discovery paper by Kaluzny et al.

However, it should be noted that the amplitudes listed for the      C1936m310 SX Phe variables seem to be unusually low.  It appears that they             C1936m310 represent half of the total light range.  More than 20 of the SXPhe          C1936m310 variables in M55 were studied by Pych et al. (2001) and when the amplitudes  C1936m310 they derived are compared with the values of Kaluzny et al. (2010),          C1936m310 Pych's amplitudes are more than a factor of 2 larger.                        C1936m310 The Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy is visible in the background field of     C1936m310 M55.  As a result, some of the variables in the M55 field are associated     C1936m310 with the Sgr galaxy and not the cluster.  This is noted in the remarks       C1936m310 column.                                                                      C1936m310 A proper motion study by Zloczewski et al.

The membership status of V7, 8, 9     C1951p186 and 11 is from Rucinski (2000). He did not analyse any of the other          C1951p186 variables.                                                                   C2003m220 Note that V18-47 are NV1-30 of Corwin et al.

For these stars,     C2003m220 the RA and dec were calculated from the x,y positions published              C2003m220 by Corwin et al. (2003) and Scott et al. (2006).  For these calculations,    C2003m220 it was assumed that the origin of their x,y system was RA=20:06:04.90 and    C2003m220 dec=-21:55:17.8. Making this assumption gave good agreement with the         C2003m220 coordinates Contreras et al. derived for the other stars.                    C2003m220 All of the remaining data for V1-47 are from Corwin et al. (2003) unless     C2003m220 indicated by PRC in the remarks column, in which case they are from Pinto    C2003m220 et al. (1982).  Corwin et al. did not derive magnitudes and amplitudes       C2003m220 for all of the variables because they used the image subtraction technique   C2003m220 for their analysis.  They observed in B and V, but only V magnitudes are     C2003m220 listed here.                                                                 C2003m220 All of the data for V48-51 are from Scott et al. (2006).                     C2003m220 Contreras et al (2012) identified 62 blue straggler stars which are          C2003m220 highly segregated in the cluster core. They published their RA, dec and      C2003m220 magnitudes.  Some of these are probably variable, but their data were        C2003m220 not suitable for carrying out a variable star search. However, the           C2003m220 position of their star BSS#5, RA=301.5202849 and dec -21.9213937, seems      C2003m220 to be close to the suspected binary V50 (NV4 of Scott et al. 2006).          C2031p072 NGC 6934 is an intermediate-metallicity cluster with [Fe/H]=-1.47            C2031p072 according to the 2010 update of the Harris (1996) catalogue.
