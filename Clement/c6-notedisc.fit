It should be noted that Szekely (2006) announced                C0100m711   some of these variables earlier, but in the  earlier paper, he used a              C0100m711   different numbering system.  The numbering system adopted in this                  C0100m711   catalogue is from Szekely et al. (2007).                                           C0100m711   In the above table, the original numbering system is maintained for the            C0100m711   previously known variables.                                                        C0100m711   Thus Sz7=V9, Sz15=V1, Sz23=V11, Sz27=V5, Sz31=V4, Sz35=V12, Sz40=V14,              C0100m711   Sz51=V16, Sz55=V13, Sz60=V8, Sz67=V6, Sz68=V3, Sz71=V7, Sz72=V15,                  C0100m711   Sz75=V10.

In fact, many of these field stars are located inside the                C0100m711   tidal radius which Harris (1996) estimated to be 10.4 arcmin in the 2010           C0100m711   revision of his catalogue.  The Sz variables which are considered to be            C0100m711   possible cluster members are listed in the above table.

Furthermore, Sz9 and Sz13 are                 C0100m711   located ~10.4 and ~15 arcmin respectively from the cluster centre -                C0100m711   close to or beyond the tidal radius.                                               C0100m711   R16 observed Sz9 and Sz28 confirmed that they are not cluster members              C0100m711   based on proper motion.                                                            C0100m711   Sz2, an Algol type eclipsing system, is located in the blue straggler              C0100m711   region of the CMD, but it lies 17 arcmin from the cluster centre,                  C0100m711   well beyond the tidal radius.  Sz82 and Sz83 are also beyond the tidal             C0100m711   radius. None of these stars are considered to be cluster members.                  C0100m711   Sz18 is located at ~3 arcmin from the cluster centre. Its position on              C0100m711   the CMD is not known, but given its location in the central region of              C0100m711   the cluster, it is assumed to be a cluster member.  R16 (2016) were                C0100m711   unable to derive reliable magnitudes for this star because its image               C0100m711   was partly blended with an overexposed star.                                       C0100m711   Long period                                                                        C0100m711   The long period variables Sz19 and Sz84 are not considered to be                   C0100m711   cluster members. Sz19 is too faint and Sz84 is well beyond the tidal               C0100m711   radius.  R16 confirmed the variability of Sz19 and concluded that the              C0100m711   star belongs to the SMC based on its proper motion and CM diagram                  C0100m711   location.                                                                          C0100m711   Sz17, Sz36 (=LW1), Sz51 (=V16) and Sz61 are all considered                         C0100m711   plausible cluster members and are listed in the above table.                       C0100m711   However, R16 did not detect any variability in Sz61.                               C0100m711   Unclassified                                                                       C0100m711   Sz4, Sz24, Sz59, Sz66, Sz70, Sz77 were not classified by S07.

When they wrote their 1971              C0310m554      paper, they were aware of the discovery of V1-6, but not V7-11.
